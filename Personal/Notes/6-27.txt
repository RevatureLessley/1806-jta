/* */ SQL Developer block comment. ctrl-/ shortcut.
Use 2 apstrophes to write an actual apostrophe in a string.
Any string in SQL Developer must be surrounded by apostrophes, not quotes.
Without CASCADE CONSTRAINTS, tables need to be dropped in order.

Referential Integrity is the enforcement of foreign key relations. It prevents a user from inserting a record into a table with a FK that points to a non-existent element. It also prevents a user from deleting a record that anoher table is referencing. We can't drop  a table that another table refereces. This all prevents orphan record that have no parents.

Aliases use quotes over apostrophes.

WHERE filters records individually.

To aggregate data:
	1. Choose which column that represents different groups.
	2. In SELECT, apply an aggreagate function to the columns not being grouped.
	3. HAVING is a conditional that applies to groups of records.
		WHERE applies first then HAVING.

LIKE searches via pseudo regex. % means 0 to many of any character. _ means exactly 1 of any character.

ROLLBACK cannot go past a COMMIT and DDL.

TRUNCATE removes all data from a table.

Aggregate functions combine multiple records together for one final result.
	-SUM()
	-AVG()
	-MAX()
	-MIN()
	-STDDDEV()
	-VARIANCE()
	-COUNT()
	-LAST()
	-FIRST()

Scalar functions alters the cell for each record of the input. Usually casting and string functions.
	-LOWER()
	-UPPER()
	-ABS()
	-COS()
	-SIN()
	-TAN()
	-ROUND()
	-TRUNC()
	-CONCAT()
	-LENGTH()
	-TRIM()
	-LTRIM()
	-RTRIM()

Join
----
Brings multiple tables together based on matching columns between each other.
	
	-INNER JOIN - data in common on join key
	-LEFT JOIN - data in common on left join key with null values for unjoined data, minimum size of left table
	-RIGHT JOIN - data in common on right join key with null values for unjoined data, minumum size of right table
	-FULL OUTER JOIN - data in common on join key with null values for unjoined data, minimum size of max table, same as OUTER JOIN
	-CROSS JOIN - cartesian product
	-THETA JOIN - not using the = operator.
	-EQUIJOIN - comparisons of columns where A = B
	-SELF JOIN
	-NATURAL JOIN - joins two tables together via matching column names then removes duplicate columns in the result. You can prefix any other join keyword  with it.

ORDER BY defaults by ascending, adding DESC orders by descending.
