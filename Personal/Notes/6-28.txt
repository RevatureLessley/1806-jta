A property file aids in making a more dynamic application. As opposed to changing code, recompiling, redeploying. 

Statements are simple SQL queries to be executed. ResultSets are objects that hold query results.

Try with resources will close any created streams within the parenthesis when the try-catch has finished.

Components/Interfaces
---------------------
Driver Manager
	-manages different database drivers
Driver
	-interface that handles communication with a specific database
Connection
	-object managing an established database communication
Statement
	-object that submits SQL statements
ResultSet
	-houses statement results
SQLException

SQL Injection is when a user inputing malicious data in order to compromise a database.

Simple Statement
----------------
-general purpose access to the database
-useful for statements with static queries
-risks SQL Injection with dynamic queries
-compiled by SQL

Prepared Statement
------------------
-more dynamic
-parameterized
-accepts input at runtime
-prevents SQL Injection
-precompiled in Java
-checks if table exists
-confirms parameter types
-parses for correct syntax
-caches for reuse

Callable Statements
-------------------
-same as prepared statement but used to invoke PL/SQL (functions and stored procedures)

Oracle has an extension called PL/SQL (Procedural Language SQL)
	- provides tools such as functions, stored procedures, sequences, triggers, exception handling.

A sequence is an object that will maintain a counter. Used with triggers. Use  / to separate transactions and other parts of the script.

A trigger is an object that listens for actions to occur on a specific table in which the trigger is made for. They can react to most CRUD operations except SELECT. BEFORE and AFTER can follow a CRUD. BEGIN END signifies a block for a transaction. 
-:new is used to represent newly inserted data. :old accesses data prior to insert/update. 
-SELECT INTO immediately grabs data and assigns it to a location/varible/table.
-dual is a dummy table used to satisfy syntax when we do not care about the table being referenced.

Stored Procedures are named transactions that are invoked when called.
CREATE (OR REPLACE) proc_name
IS
	//DECLARE variables
BEGIN
	//execution or other functions
[Exception]
	//exception handling
END;

Invoked in two ways
1. Via a transaction block BEGIN proc_name(); END;
2. Outside transaction block call proc_name();

To access the dbms_output console, View > Dbms_output brings the window where  + selects the current scheme and opens the console.

Procedures define transactions that change data. Parameters in stored procedures:
	-IN - input
	-OUT - return
	-IN OUT - input then output
Syntax: varname In/OUT/IN OUT

DECLARE declares variables in a transaction block. := assigns variables.

Cursors are like pointers to a table/view. They iterate through entire queries and are used to pass entire queries. PL/SQL offers SYS_RECURSOR that can be passed outside of its procedure's scope. A CURSOR would have died. CURSORS are like streams that you OPEN for queries.
