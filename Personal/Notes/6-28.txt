A property file aids in making a more dynamic application. As opposed to changing code, recompiling, redeploying. 

Statements are simple SQL queries to be executed. ResultSets are objects that hold query results.

Try with resources will close any created streams within the parenthesis when the try-catch has finished.

Components/Interfaces
---------------------
Driver Manager
	-manages different database drivers
Driver
	-interface that handles communication with a specific database
Connection
	-object managing an established database communication
Statement
	-object that submits SQL statements
ResultSet
	-houses statement results
SQLException

SQL Injection is when a user inputing malicious data in order to compromise a database.

Simple Statement
----------------
-general purpose access to the database
-useful for statements with static queries
-risks SQL Injection with dynamic queries
-compiled by SQL

Prepared Statement
------------------
-more dynamic
-parameterized
-accepts input at runtime
-prevents SQL Injection
-precompiled in Java
-checks if table exists
-confirms parameter types
-parses for correct syntax
-caches for reuse

Callable Statements
-------------------
-same as prepared statement but used to invoke PL/SQL (functions and stored procedures)
