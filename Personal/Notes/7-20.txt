Get vs Load
-Get is eager, it will fetch all data from the database on the spot, replacing non-existing data with null.
-Load is lazy, it gives us a proxy of an object, a proxy is a pseudo-implementation of the object structure, database is only hit when the actual data is accessed, risks ObjectNotFound Exception

session.persist() is not guaranteed an id immediately so it returns nothing.

Save vs Persist
-neither lazy nor eager
-save an object writes it to the database, thus it returns a number that uniquely identifies a record.
-persist does not write immediately, a position is saved without an id.

Update vs Merge
-they re-attach a detached object to a persistent state.
-update throws an NonUniqueObject exception of you a session already has a persistent object for a record.
-merge still follows through by overwriting the contents of the current consistent object with the one attempting to update.

HQL is like SQL without column selections. Projections allow statistical queries on the database.

Criteria is an OO-based query. SQL is written inside NativeQuery.
