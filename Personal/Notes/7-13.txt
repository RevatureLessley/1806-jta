Directives can invoke functionality with an html files. They are html syntax that can be used without breaking the frontend. A non-html element/attributes preceded with ng are likely to be directives. Directives with an asterisk (*) is a structural directivre that is capable of changing the structure of HTML, adding/removing elements on the page.

In addition to templateURL, template literals build the html within the typescript file itself. This replaces 'templateUrl' with 'template' followed by backticks (`) with code in between

*ngFor adds elements based off an array.

ng g directive directives/custom <- generates a cutom directive.

Encasing a selector with [] tells angular it has an element property instead of an element.

-Public is accessible outside of the typescript file.
-Private is accessible only inside the typescript file.

Use private for constructor parameters.

Any directive used as an attribute of an element is called an Attribute Directive.
