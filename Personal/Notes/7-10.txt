clear() clears the console.
only three datatypes: string, number, boolean, function, object, undefined
1/0 and 1/-0 is infinity.
Errors: ReferenceError
null is an object but is not typeof nor instanceof Object.
undefined means a variable without a value. 
undefined == null <- true. === compares values.
undefined === null <- false. === compares values and datatypes.
JavaScript does type coercion.
false == "false" <- false.
Boolean logic works like in C.
"bobbert" * 3 is NaN, which is typeof number.
\ is the escape character.
[] denotes arrays. {} denotes objects.
x = []; x.push(value). Arrays does not have typing. Indexes could be anything, including Infinity, NaN, null.
console.log() is standard output.
x.pop() gets the last index that is a Number.
x.unshift() gets the first index that is a Number.
x.splice(Number i, Number j, Object o) insertas o at i, destroying j following elements.
x.sort() sorts indexes like strings. x.sort(Function) sorts by Function.
