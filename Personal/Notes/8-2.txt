Jax-ws is the API for SOAP  web services. REST uses Jax-rs.
Apache Crossfire (cxf) is a SOAP framework whereas Jersey is a REST framework.

SOAP vs REST
	-SOAP
		--more overhead due to heavy configuration and provided features
		--more secure, offering WS-Security.
		--HTTP and SMTP protocols
		--restricted to XML encoding.
	-REST
		--less overhead but all features must be manually implemented.
		--programmer implements security.
		--HTTP only
		--encodable with text, JSON, XML, etc...

Testing Webservices
	-REST
		--Postman
		--RestAssured
	-SOAP tested by SOAP_UI, can also test REST but all features not free
