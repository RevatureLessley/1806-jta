Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
	-handles sytem maintenance, backup, resiliency planning.
	-resources provided are highly scalable.
	-automation of admin tasks.
Software as a Service (SaaS)
	-offer the required software applications for use.
	-IDE, Office Suite, etc...
Platform as a Service (PaaS)
	-hardware and software provisions.
	-offers entire jre/jdk.
	-provides security tools.

Regions
	-Server Centers
	-physical locations
	-provide availablility zones.
		--data centers
		--provide networks and connections

EC2 -Elastic Cloud Compute
    -create virtual machines on the cloud.
    -pay for what is used
    -utilizes an AMI and EBS
		--AMI -Amazon Machine Image
		      -actual OS provisioned by AWS
		      -has most options
		      -Amazon linux is based off of red hat.
		--EBS -Elastic Block Store
		      -storage for an EC2 instance.
		      -persistent block storage
		      -high availablilty, durability

S3 -Simple Storage Service
   -file server
   -uses buckets for storage
   -one of the first services of AWS
   -supports version control
   -useful for backing up databses and disaster recovery.
   -5 GB free tier usage

Autoscaling
	-unsures enough EC2 instances for users.
	-creates an auto-scaling group of EC2s.
	-when one EC2 reaches capacity, another starts.
	-when capacity drops, extra EC2s are shutdown.

ELB -Elastic Load Balancers
    -distribute traffic between multiple EC2s.
    -maintains healthy EC2s that do not lose packets.
    -high fault tolerance by redirecting users to safe EC2s when one fails.

RDS -Relational Database Service
    -cost efficient, resizable
    -manages most DBA tasks.
    -support for:
	--Oracle
	--mySQL
	--SQL Server
	--Aurora
	--Postgres
	--Maria
    -automatically manages backups

DynamoDB
	-noSQL engine for AWS

Route53
	-DNS for AWS
	-routes users to IP from name
	-responsible for performing health checks on EC2.
	
VPC -Virtual Private Cloud
    -self contained intranet for a company
    -allows VPN connections and restrictions 

DevOps -Development Operations
       -combines devloper and operations (systadmin)
       -aims to automate as much processes as possible throughout the development lifecycle.
       -achieved through continuous integration/deployment/delivery
		--CI/CD
		--always pushing code that goes through a pipeline
			---code is tested/analyzed
			---code is deployed after all tests pass
			---code is end-to-end tested.
			---team notified every step of the way.
			---saves time and money by identifying errors early.
			---achieved with Jenkins.

Cardinal Rules
--------------
-never push bad code with errors.
-always achieve 100% test coverage.
	--JUnit test for every method.
-always be pushing code
	--40 to 80 Jenkins build a day in a team of 1 to 3.
-always fix build failures.
	--never leave office with build failure.

TDD -Test Driven Development
    -write test first that are guaranteed to fail.
    -write code to past test.
