Functional Testing does actions/results/responses of application in reaction to input/interaction.
	-Developer
		--Unit Test
			---most micro level of testing.
			---aims to test indiviual methods.

		--Integration Testing
			---aims to test components.
			---multiple methods that rely on each other.

	-Devloper and Tester
		--System Testing does entire application as a whole.
		--End to End Testing
			---application from start to finish.
			---does not cover all functionality, just a use case.

	-BA/SA	
		--User Acceptance Testing aims to see if direct requirements and user stories are met.
		--2 levels:
			---Alpha Testing is done in house using people on staff, not the actual developers/testers.
			---Beta Testing is done offsite, typically by end users or a pool of non-tech people.

	-Exhaustive Testing does every single aspect of the application.
	-Boundary Testing does min, max, before min, after max.
	-Black Box Testing does not have access to application code.
		--UAT, E2E, Usability
	-White Box Testing is based around the application code.
		--Unit, Integration, System
	-Equivalence Partitioning sections off test range.

Non-Functional Testing 
	-does application states and vulnerabilities as well as subjective use.
	-benchmarks
	-Penetration Testing
	-Usability Testing
	-Performance Testing
		--Spike Testing
		--Ramp Up/Down Testing
		--Load Testing
		--Stress Testing does passed expected user count

Positive Testing
	-when inputing proper actions, receive expected results
	-the happy path

Negative Testing
	-does applicaton handle erroneous input properly
	-try to break application
